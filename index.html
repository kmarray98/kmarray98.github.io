        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a PhD candidate at the 
          <a href="https://spatialeconomics.nl/en/">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a> 
          and <a href="https://tinbergen.nl/home">Tinbergen Institute</a>, supervised by 
          <a href="https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/michael-konig">Michael Konig</a> and 
          <a href="https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ozan-candogan">Ozan Candogan</a>. I am also a fellow in the
          <a href="https://www.popnet.io/">POPulation-scale social NETwork analysis project</a> at the 
          <a href="https://ias.uva.nl/">Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Amsterdam</a>. 
          I also hold an MPhil in Economics and Econometrics (cum laude) from the Tinbergen Institute, and a BA in Philosophy and Economics from Oxford.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>Econometrics of networks, economics of networks, machine learning for economics.</p>
    <p> My research focuses on the implications of unobserved and partially observed networks in economic problems. I combine methods from classical econometrics and modern statistics with economic theory to explore how unobserved structure affects
      economic outcomes. I also examine the implications for optimal policy.</p>

          I received a Sloan Foundation Minor Research Grant for Mesoeconomics with Xianglong Kong, Kathryn McDonald, Peter Ohlinger, and Ruochen Dai.

  <div class="abstract">
   Empirical researchers often estimate spillover effects by fitting linear or non-linear regression models to sampled network data. 
    We show that common sampling schemes induce dependence between spillovers on observed and unobserved links that biases estimates, often upwards. 
    We then construct unbiased estimators by rescaling the regression estimators using aggregate statistics of the degree distribution. 
    Our results can be used to construct estimates under different assumptions on the relationship between observed and unobserved links, bound true effect sizes, and determine robustness to missing links. 
    As an application, we estimate the propagation of climate shocks between US public firms from self-reported supply links using a new dataset on the county-level incidence of large climate shocks.

  <div class="abstract">
We study disease spread on a social network where individuals adjust contacts to avoid infection. Susceptible individuals rewire links from infectious individuals to other susceptibles, reducing infections and causing the disease to only become endemic at higher infection rates.
  We formulate the plannerâ€™s problem of implementing targeted lockdowns to control endemic disease as a semidefinite program that is computationally tractable even with many groups. 
    Rewiring complements policy by allowing more intergroup contact as the rewiring rate increases. 
    We apply our model to compute optimal spatially-targeted lockdowns for the Netherlands during Covid-19 using a population-level contact network for 17.26 million individuals. 
    Our findings indicate that, with rewiring, a targeted lockdown policy permits 12% more contacts compared to one without rewiring, underscoring the significance of accounting for network endogeneity in effective policy design.
