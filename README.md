# About me

I am a research master student in economics and econometrics at the Tinbergen Institute. I work on econometrics of networks. In October, I will be starting a Phd at VU Amsterdam supervised by [Dr Michael Konig](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/michael-konig). Previously, I was at the Complexity Economics group at [INET Oxford](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/) under Prof. J. Doyne Farmer and Dr Francois Lafond.
